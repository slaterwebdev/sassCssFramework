//Sass file solely for functions - modular approach
//Functions are very similar to mixins but instead of "outputting" multiple styles it outputs a single value
@function light-comp ($color) {
    $compliment: compliment($color);
    $lighten: lighten($compliment);
    @return $light-compliment;
}
//Takes in the parameter and performs multiple sass functions on to it
//That is the basis of SASS functions putting a variable through multiple sass functions/changes
